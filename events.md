    Transnational private regulation has emerged and flourished in domains traditionally associated to public authority. Polycentric and de-centred conceptualisation of regulatory governance identity a margin for the public steering of private regimes, including via proceduralisation. This paper illustrates a few instances where private regulators have anticipated public intervention, instrumentally reacted to forms of indirect control, and continued their assertion of regulatory functions as undisturbed from public authority as possible. This contribution aims at locating the source of elusiveness into the considerable resourcefulness enjoyed by transnational private regulators. In particular, rapidity of standard-setting, extreme organisational flexibility and continuous learning are of paramount importance to informally pre-empt public regulation and defuse demands for reform from public and private stakeholders. In a similar manner, setting standards which structure economic activity in a manner which is congenial to the preference of private interests for light-touch rules, while signalling nonetheless effective regulatory competences, confers an influence in the regulation of markets and market-related activities which is almost impossible to harness by public authority.

- Ruhela, S. (2019, May). _The Resilience of Standard - Setting Bodies in Banking: The Case Study of Basel Committee on Banking Supervision_. Presented at the ['Investment, Banking and Antitrust Session' at 8th SIEL PEPA Conference, King’s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/events/8th-pepasiel-conference).

    REVEAL member, Shanya Ruhela (Ph.D. Researcher) presented her work-in-progress at the 8th Conference of the Postgraduate and Early Professionals/Academics Network of the Society of International Economic Law (PEPA/SIEL), held in London on May 30-31, 2019. Her presentation was on understanding the resilience of standard setting bodies in banking by undertaking a case study of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Committee”).

    The Committee is a self-enforcing institution, which promulgates minimum banking standards at an international level. These standards have no legal, binding or coercive force mandating compliance. Her work attempts to decipher the changes that occurred in standard-setting process of the Committee as a result of the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, which ultimately led to negotiation and adoption of a new set of standards (Basel III). Resilience is the capacity to experience shocks while retaining identity. The overarching aim of her research is to identify the key strategies for resilience of non-state actors or private standard-setting bodies by examining the evolution of standard-setting process by the Committee.
